<h2 id="tracks">Tracks</h2>
<h3 id="beginner-track">Beginner Track</h3>
<p><em>Meant for people with no coding experience</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Basic concepts on AI (teachable machine + ML playground) on Day 1</li>
  <li>Introduce Design Thinking and Figma on Day 1</li>
  <li>Python Workshops on Days 1 and 2</li>
  <li>Ease into AI with a very simple tool (PyCaret on Day 2)</li>
</ul>

<p>The final competition would be an ideathon, where we will provide you with a randomly selected dataset, and you are to pitch a “start-up” idea with one or more of these datasets.</p>

<h3 id="intermediate-track">Intermediate Track</h3>
<p><em>Meant for people with coding experience</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Refresh AI concepts and how to process data using NumPy, Pandas on Day 1</li>
  <li>How to use Scikit-Learn to train models on Day 1</li>
  <li>How to use Tensorflow to train Neural Networks and CNNs on Day 2</li>
  <li>More interesting Computer Vision techniques using OpenCV on Day 2</li>
</ul>

<p>Your final competition will be split into two different tasks: training and tuning a model on a dataset provided by us, and pitching a product idea using the said dataset.</p>

<h3 id="advanced-track">Advanced Track</h3>
<p><em>Meant for people who have done AI before</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Modern AI (eg Transformers and ViTs) on Day 1</li>
  <li>Git and GitHub for Version Control on Day 1</li>
  <li>Integrating AI into Flask on Day 1</li>
  <li>Graph Neural Networks on Day 2</li>
  <li>MLOps on Day 2</li>
</ul>

<p>This would be a full-blown hackathon, where you will be given a prompt and encouraged to develop products based around that prompt.</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>Must I be present the entire time for the June Conference?</strong>
<br />You may be excused for one day of the conference if you have other commitments / events, although you are encouraged to come on all days since the workshops progressively build on your knowledge!</p>

<p><strong>Is there an online rendition of the conference?</strong>
<br />We seek for optimal engagement during this year’s conference and therefore it will be fully physical, not online.</p>

<p><strong>Why should I sign up?</strong>

<p><strong>Must I go for all workshops / talks?</strong>
<br />Yes, all tracks require certain skills which will be taught progressively in the workshops!</p>

<p><strong>What if something pops up and I can’t make it?</strong>
<br />Email us at <a href="mailto:buildingblocs@computing.sg">buildingblocs@computing.sg</a> or approach us on <a href="https://discord.gg/VSHyrbsJFs">Discord</a> in any appropriate channels and we will update your signup status accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>How will the hackathon group be allocated?</strong>
