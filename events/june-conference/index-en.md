## Tracks
### Beginner Track
_Meant for people with no coding experience_
- Basic concepts on AI (teachable machine + ML playground) on Day 1
- Introduce Design Thinking and Figma on Day 1
- Python Workshops on Days 1 and 2
- Ease into AI with a very simple tool (PyCaret on Day 2)

The final competition would be an ideathon, where we will provide you with a randomly selected dataset, and you are to pitch a "start-up" idea with one or more of these datasets.

### Intermediate Track
_Meant for people with coding experience_
- Refresh AI concepts and how to process data using NumPy, Pandas on Day 1
- How to use Scikit-Learn to train models on Day 1
- How to use Tensorflow to train Neural Networks and CNNs on Day 2
- More interesting Computer Vision techniques using OpenCV on Day 2

Your final competition will be split into two different tasks: training and tuning a model on a dataset provided by us, and pitching a product idea using the said dataset.

### Advanced Track
_Meant for people who have done AI before_
- Modern AI (eg Transformers and ViTs) on Day 1
- Git and GitHub for Version Control on Day 1
- Integrating AI into Flask on Day 1
- Graph Neural Networks on Day 2
- MLOps on Day 2

This would be a full-blown hackathon, where you will be given a prompt and encouraged to develop products based around that prompt.
