<h2 id="what-is-buildingblocs">What is BuildingBloCS?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Computing students come together to build a infocomm-empowered future!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>BuildingBloCS is a year-long outreach programme for students, by students, aimed at promoting more exposure to Computing and CS as a whole for Secondary School, JC and IP students. We organise activities, workshops and various events (sometimes with external organisations), and we annually organise both the <strong>March</strong> and <strong>June</strong> Conferences to give students a platform to not just learn more about the different facets of computing, but also share their own interesting approaches to other students. Activities need not be entirely technical, and they can be something like creatively integrating Computing concepts into usual activities!</p>

<h3 id="history-of-buildingblocs">History of BuildingBloCS</h3>

<p>We started out in 2017 as a VIA project, but since then, we have expanded our operations to an unprecendented scale. In 2022 alone, nearly 150 students from various Secondary Schools, JCs and IP Schools participated in our June Conference, and we hope to continue this.</p>

<h3 id="discord">Discord</h3>

<p>We use Discord for major communications, and post regular updates through the server. It will be the easiest and quickest way to get the most up-to-date information regarding upcoming BuildingBloCS events and workshops.</p>
