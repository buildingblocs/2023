</p>

<p style="text-align: center"> The FOSSASIA Summit 2023is a hybrid event conducted both online and in-person, part of a series of FOSSASIA events held since 2009. Participate to connect with businesses, developers, and tech communities from around the world and learn about the latest developments in open source! 
BuildingBloCS is proud to be partnering FOSSASIA to present several workshops and talks, as well as our very own exhibition booth at the FOSSASIA Summit 2023.

## Talks/Workshops

### _Exploring the Forward-Forward Algorithm_
During the NeurIps 2022, Geoffrey Hinton introduced the Forward-Forward algorithm, something that made back-propagation unnecessary and modeled neural networks more like human brains. This talk will be exploring the implementation and the effectiveness of this new algorithm and look at some examples of it being in use.

### _Steganographic malware embedding in AI models_
Traditional steganographic techniques are widespread and easily identified. With the explosion of embedded AI in mainstream applications, let's take a new perspective and explore its implications for the steganographic scene.

### _Artificial Intelligence in Astronomy and Physics_
We demonstrate the importance of artificial intelligence in the field of astronomy and physics, through explaining the underlying mechanisms behind neural networks: a powerful machine learning algorithm which uses trainable parameters in a graph to generate an output, and uses in Astronomical Object Classification and Gravitational Wave Detection.

### _Unleashing the Power of Graph Neural Networks_
Graphs are all around us. From railway networks to puzzle states it is clear that they are an integral type of data. However when it comes to machine learning, standard neural networks do not account for structural information which is key when learning on graph-structured data. Graph neural networks circumvent this problem by learning both structural and spatial biases from the input graph. In this workshop, we will be exploring how Graph neural nets work and their different applications!

### _Processing and Presenting Data With Python’s Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn And More!_
This workshop will focus on data science and how it is applicable to businesses. We will focus on data science modules of python such as Numpy and Pandas and will teach them on how to use such modules to read CSV files and other file types, delete/remove or modify data and export it or present it using data visualisation modules such as matplotlib and seaborn.
