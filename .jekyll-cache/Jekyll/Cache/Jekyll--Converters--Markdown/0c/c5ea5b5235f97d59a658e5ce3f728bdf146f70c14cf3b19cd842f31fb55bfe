<h2 id="starvation-competition">Starvation Competition</h2>

<p>Capping off the March Conference will be a contest, but one that might catch some off guard. Unlike the classic Hackathon 
adopted in the June Conference, we will instead be organising our very own “Hackathon” for open-source
 ー Starvation. It’s an open source gamified coding platform inspired by <a href="https://codecombat.com/">CodeCombat</a>, with the gameplay influenced by <a href="https://battlecats.club/en/series/battlecats/">BattleCats</a>. Solve coding challenges by applying your Python and data skills from the workshops for a beginner progression!</p>
